Git How-To

Working with GitHub on VS Code
	1. Clone the Repo: gh repo clone USER/REPO_NAME
		ex. cjthomas730/environment
		- Nav to ~/GitHub then clone
	2. Make a new venv, ENV_NAME, with conda
	
	3. To begin work, activate the venv, nav to project Directory

	Branches
	4. Check current branch with: "git status"
	5. Make new branch with: "git branch BRANCH-NAME"
	6. Switch to branch with: "git switch BRANCH-NAME"

	7. Work on branch
	8. Add changes to code to a future push with git add FILENAME
		- ex. changes made to requirements.txt >> git add requirements.txt
	9. Commit the change with a message using "git commit -m "Messge here...." "
		- ex. git commit -m "Updated the requirements.txt to include selenium" 
	10. Push the branch back to main when ready
		- git push --set-upstream origin BRANCH-NAME

	Pull Request
	11. Go to the GitHub project page to make the pull request
	12. After PR finished, Squash and Merge

	Update Repo
	13. Switch back to main branch
	14. Make sure local repo is up-to-date with a git pull
		- git pull
	15. After the PR is done, remove remote branches from local Git if they don't still exist
		- git fetch --prune

Bringing Changes from main into the current branch
	1. git checkout <main-branch>
	2. git pull
	3. git checkout <branch>
	4. git merge <main-branch>
